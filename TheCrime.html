					joked the emcee of the 2016 community building event Ignite Lincoln. While a rumbling chuckle spread across the audience, he managed to holdback his snickering while referring to South of Downtown residents as either “witnesses” or “perpetrators” of crime scenes.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					The emcee’s jokes demonstrate a widely accepted characterization of the South of Downtown neighborhood and its residents. People who don’t live there — and apparently a few who do — know little about South of Downtown except what they have heard about the crime. 
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Many South of Downtown residents have a very different perception of their neighborhood. They believe the negative characterizations of the crime are exaggerated or even flat-out wrong.

				<div class="ba bw1 bw2-ns pv3 pv4-ns ma3 mh5-ns cf">

						“I walk through [South of Downtown] all the time and nothing bad has ever happened to me. We could use some better lighting at night, but I don’t think it’s [dangerous].”

				</div>
					
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Some residents believe the media over-reports sensationalized crimes. Others believe there’s negative bias towards the ethnicities and class of the residents. But most residents agree that the high number of crime reports are mostly due to the higher number of people living in South of Downtown relative to other neighborhoods in Lincoln.

				<h2 class="tc f3 f2-ns mt4 mb0">Total Number of Crime Reports Suggests High Crime</h2>
				
				<img src="images/TotalCrime.png" alt="bell curve of neighborhood crime report totals and South of Downtown falling in the category of High" class="w-100 mb3">
				
				<p class="center measure-wide lh-copy f4 f4-ns fw3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Crime statistics for neighborhoods are typically reported as the number of total crimes. In 2014, Lincoln neighborhoods reported approximately 380 crimes on average. To be considered high crime, a neighborhood would report more than 1,200 crimes. South of Downtown reported approximately 1,250 crimes. This statistic agrees with the characterization of high crime.
				</p>

				
				<h2 class="tc f3 f2-ns mt4 mb0">South of Downtown has High Population Density</h2>
				
				<img src="images/NeighborhoodDensity.png" alt="bell curve of neighborhood densities and South of Downtown falling in the category of High" class="w-100 mb3">
				
				<p class="center measure-wide lh-copy f4 f4-ns fw3 ph5-ns ma0">
					In 2014, South of Downtown was also the most densely populated neighborhood in the city of Lincoln. South of Downtown has a population density of 4,790 and the average in Lincoln is just 1,448. Crime statistics will need to be adjusted for the differences in population density between neighborhoods to better represent comparisons of neighborhood crime rates; especially with neighborhoods in Lincoln that are as densely populated as South of Downtown.
				</p>

				<h2 class="tc f3 f2-ns mt4 mb0">Crime Perception Changes When Adjusted for Population</h2>
				<img src="images/PopulationAdjustedCrime.png" alt="bell curve of neighborhood crime when adjusted for populations of the neighborhoods and South of Downtown falling in the category of Above Average" class="w-100 mb3">
				<p class="center measure-wide lh-copy f4 f4-ns fw3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Simply adding population in crime reporting demonstrates the difference in how crime would be reported and perceived. When crime is adjusted for population, a high crime neighborhood will report more than 932 crimes per 1,000 residents. South of Downtown reported only 237 crimes per 1,000 residents. This is still well above average, but South of Downtown’s crime would not be considered high for Lincoln given its relatively large population.
				</p>

				<h2 class="tc f3 f2-ns mt4 mb0">Crime Average When Adjusted for Neighborhood Density</h2>
				<img src="images/DensityAdjustedCrime.png" alt="bell curve of neighborhood crime when adjusted for densities of the neighborhoods and South of Downtown falling in the category of Average" class="w-100 mb3">
				<p class="center measure-wide lh-copy f4 f4-ns fw3 ph5-ns ma0">
					South of Downtown’s crime is not much different from the majority of neighborhoods in Lincoln; in fact, its slightly less. When crime is adjusted for density, high crime neighborhoods will report more than 630 crimes per unit of density. South of Downtown only reported 26 crimes per unit of density; the average is 28 crimes per unit density. Comparing crime between Lincoln neighborhoods, without adjusting for density, is like comparing crime in Farwell to crime in Lincoln; apples and oranges.

						Perception is the problem, not crime.
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Make no mistake, pockets of habitual crime exist in South of Downtown And, residents make efforts to report them to local law enforcement  - though more strategies are needed to create lasting results from that process. Nevertheless, this story should not define the neighborhood. 
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Downtown has a crime rate comparable to South of Downtown, but that hasn’t stopped them from attracting new investment into their neighborhood. They regularly and publicly educate others in Lincoln on what’s great about their neighborhood. They double down on the positive perceptions to crowd out the negative ones.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Dysfunctional density is also contributing to perceived and actual crime in South of Downtown. In The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs explains that crime prevention is inherent to well-functioning density; it’s built into the design.
				</p>
				
				<div class="ba bw1 bw2-ns pv3 pv4-ns ma3 mh5-ns cf">
					<p class="lh-copy-ns center measure f4 f3-ns ph3 ph5-ns ma0">
						“To build [neighborhoods] that are custom made for easy crime is idiotic. Yet that is what we do.”
					</p>
					<p class="measure f4 f3-ns i fr ph3 ph5-ns ma0">— Jane Jacobs</p>
				</div>

				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					It should be noted that there’s also noticeable improvements to crime in South of Downtown. This positive story should be shared publicly and regularly. Also, residents shouldn't expect others to stop contributing to the negative characterizations of their neighborhood before they do.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f3 fw3 fw4-ns ph3 ph5-ns ma0">
					The change must start with residents.
