						joked the emcee of the 2016 community building event Ignite Lincoln. While a rumbling chuckle spread across the audience, he managed to holdback his snickering while referring to South of Downtown residents as either “witnesses” or “perpetrators” of crime scenes.
					</p>
					<p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
						The emcee’s jokes demonstrate a widely accepted characterization of the South of Downtown neighborhood and its residents. People who don’t live there — and apparently a few who do — know little about South of Downtown except what they have heard about the crime. 
					</p>
					<p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
						Many South of Downtown residents have a very different perception of their neighborhood. They believe the negative characterizations of the crime are exaggerated or even flat-out wrong.

						Some residents believe the media over-reports sensationalized crimes. Others believe there’s negative bias towards the ethnicities and class of the residents. But most residents agree that the high number of crime reports are mostly due to the higher number of people living in South of Downtown relative to other neighborhoods in Lincoln.

						Crime statistics for neighborhoods are typically reported as the number of total crimes. In 2014, Lincoln neighborhoods reported approximately 380 crimes on average. To be considered high crime, a neighborhood would report more than 1,200 crimes. South of Downtown reported approximately 1,250 crimes. This statistic agrees with the characterization of high crime.

						In 2014, South of Downtown was also the most densely populated neighborhood in the city of Lincoln and the 2nd most densly populated neighborhood in the entire state of Nebraska. South of Downtown has a population density of 4,790 and the average in Lincoln is 1,448. Crime statistics will need to be adjusted for the differences in population density between neighborhoods to better represent comparisons of neighborhood crime rates, especially with neighborhoods in Lincoln that are as densely populated as South of Downtown.

					<p class="info-description f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
						Simply adding population in crime reporting demonstrates the difference in how crime would be reported and perceived. When crime is adjusted for population, a high crime neighborhood will report more than 932 crimes per 1,000 residents. South of Downtown reported only 237 crimes per 1,000 residents. This is still above average, but South of Downtown’s crime would not be considered high for Lincoln given its relatively large population.

					<p class="info-description f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mt2 mb4 mh0">
						South of Downtown’s crime is not much different from the majority of neighborhoods in Lincoln. In fact, its slightly less. When crime is adjusted for density, high crime neighborhoods will report more than 630 crimes per unit of density. South of Downtown only reported 26 crimes per unit of density - the average is 28. Comparing crime between Lincoln neighborhoods, without adjusting for density, is like comparing crime in Farwell to crime in Lincoln; apples and oranges.

						Make no mistake, pockets of habitual crime exist in South of Downtown. Residents do make efforts to report them to local law enforcement, and even though more strategies are needed to create lasting results from that process, this story should not define the neighborhood. 
					</p>
					<p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
						Downtown has a crime rate comparable to South of Downtown, but they have managed to not define their neighborhood by their crime. They regularly and publicly educate others in Lincoln on what’s great about their neighborhood. Their doubling down on the positive perceptions to crowd out the negative ones.
					</p>
					<p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
						Dysfunctional density is also contributing to perceived and actual crime in South of Downtown. In her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, Jane Jacobs explains that crime prevention is inherent to well-functioning density; it’s built into the design.
