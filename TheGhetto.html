						Homeowners, landlords, and tenants alike point to those neglecting upkeep of their property as a major reason why a neighborhood becomes a ghetto.

					<p class="f4 f3-ns fw3 pa0 mv3">
						Many do their fair share to maintain the character of the neighborhood. They believe it’s unfair that others are not accepting their neighborly responsibility to maintain their property.

						Residents also believe the city must contribute their fair share of maintenance and improvements in the South of Downtown neighborhood. As an owner of the largest portfolios of property, the city has a large stake in the decline of South of Downtown into a ghetto.

						A common prescription for this largely working-class to low-income neighborhood is to entice higher income residents to move into their neighborhood, thus creating a more “mixed-income” neighborhood. Another prescription is to attract private investment for new developments with the expectation that it will generate the tax revenue required to justify public investments in the neighborhood.
