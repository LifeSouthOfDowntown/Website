						Who makes a neighborhood ghetto?

					Homeowners, landlords, and tenants alike point to those neglecting upkeep of their property as a major reason why a neighborhood becomes a ghetto.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Many do their fair share to maintain the character of the neighborhood. They believe it’s unfair that others are not accepting their neighborly responsibility to maintain their property.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Residents also believe the city must contribute their fair share of maintenance and improvements in the South of Downtown neighborhood. As an owner of the largest portfolios of property, the city has a large stake in the decline of South of Downtown into a ghetto.

				<div class="bg-light-gray pv3 pv4-ns ma3 mh5-ns cf">

						A typical reason for the lack in public investment is a lack of money.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					A common prescription for this largely working-class neighborhood is to entice higher income residents to move into their neighborhood, thus creating a more “mixed-income” neighborhood. Another prescription is to attract private investment for new developments with the expectation that it will generate the tax revenue required to justify public investments in the neighborhood.
				</p>

				<h2 class="mt0 f3 f2-ns mb4 lh-solid mb0">
					Will working-class neighborhoods ever generate enough money to warrant improvements? Must they depend on outside investors to justify public investments?

					When it comes to property taxes, South of Downtown is a top performer in Lincoln. At $32,247 per acre, South of Downtown is the highest contributor to property taxes  after #1 ranked Downtown. That’s 4 times more than all the Walmarts in Lincoln combined.

					When it comes to wheel taxes, South of Downtown out performs every neighborhood in Lincoln. At $1,342 per acre, South of Downtown contributes more to wheel taxes than any other neighborhood in Lincoln. It yields twice as much as the #2 contributor and 4 times as much as Downtown.

						Where’s the residents’ return on investment?

				</div>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					If looking for mega-projects as evidence of private investment, none will be found in the South of Downtown neighborhood. It’s already built out and inhabited by many residents. Mega-projects won’t be popping up like they will in Lincoln’s less inhabited Telegraph, Railyard, and South Haymarket districts.

				<div class="bg-light-gray pv3 pv4-ns ma3 mh5-ns cf">
					<p class="lh-copy-ns center measure f4 f3-ns ph3 ph5-ns ma0">
						Despite the lack of mega-projects, private investments are still being made South of Downtown.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					Many small private investments are being made by residents, homeowners, landlords, and small businesses.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					They’re starting new businesses, altering interiors to better serve customers, creating new entertainment events and festivals, restoring older buildings to preserve their historic character, improving private properties to provide community-owned public space, and making many other small to moderate investments that are within their means.
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
					These small private investments may not warrant large public mega-projects like mid-rise parking garages and tourist-attracting stadiums. But, just like the small private investments in South of Downtown,
				</p>
				<p class="center measure lh-copy f3 fw3 fw4-ns ph3 ph5-ns ma0">
					small public investments add up to large community impact.
