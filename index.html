						The confusion starts South of Downtown.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						Today, the South of Downtown neighborhood is characterized as being helplessly challenged by crime and decline. There’s a sense of urgency to improve South of Downtown with new developments to reverse its trajectory.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						But today, locally-owned businesses are also seen popping up or making targeted investments in the interior of their small shops. Residents are hearing and sharing stories of recent house shows for music, art, and films accompanied by civic discourse. There’s new participation in community-owned space including anything from discussions on prose to neighbors sewing clothes, all with an undercurrent of “Do-It-Ourselves”.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						Today, many people South of Downtown and across the city of Lincoln have heard the common characterizations of the crime; the poverty; the ghetto; the apathy.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						But today, there’s also something about South of Downtown that makes people show up to family game nights with 200 of their neighbors; something that makes people bullish on their small business’s future; something that makes people committed to literally planting roots in their community.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						Can a neighborhood be on its way down, and on its way up?
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						The South of Downtown paradox deserves a closer look. This project conducted a quantitative and qualitative exploration of the neighborhood in an attempt to shed some light on the matter.
					</p>
					<p class="center measure lh-copy f4 f3-ns fw3 pa3 ph5-ns ma0">
						The results may suprise you.
